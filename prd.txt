# YTM Group Website Redesign - Product Requirements Document

<context>
# Overview

YTM Group is a comprehensive financial services business operating across Australia, offering mortgage and finance solutions, financial planning, legal services, business insurance, business advisory, and property services. Their current website at ytmgroup.com.au lacks modern design elements, has poor user experience, and limited visual engagement compared to contemporary financial services websites.

This project aims to completely redesign and redevelop their website using modern technologies (React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS) to create a professional, trustworthy, and refined digital presence that enhances brand credibility, improves user experience, increases lead generation, and positions YTM Group as a forward-thinking financial services provider while maintaining their core brand identity.

The solution addresses the critical need for a modern web presence that converts visitors into leads through improved user experience, professional design, and clear value proposition communication.
